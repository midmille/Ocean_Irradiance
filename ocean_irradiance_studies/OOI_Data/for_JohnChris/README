The shape of the array should be: 

[Nvariables, Nprofs, Ndepths, Nwavelengths]

Where Nvariables = 6 for variables time, depth, wavelength, absorption, scattering, and fluorometric_chla. 

arr[0, :,:,:] = time
arr[1, :,:,:] = depth
arr[2, :,:,:] = wavelength
arr[3, :,:,:] = absorption
arr[4, :,:,:] = scattering
arr[5, :,:,:] = chla
